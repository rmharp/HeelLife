2. Enable Gmail API for your project
3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
4. Download the JSON credentials file
5. Configure gmailr in your R session:
```r
library(gmailr)
gm_auth_configure(path = "path/to/your/credentials.json")
gm_auth(email = TRUE, cache = ".secret")
```

### Option 3: Interactive Input
