# Edit with your credentials
ONYEN_USERNAME="your_onyen"
ONYEN_PASSWORD="your_password"
```

### Option 2: Gmail API Setup (Required for Gmail Department Emails)
For sending emails to departments via Gmail API, you'll need to set up Gmail API:

1. Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable Gmail API for your project
3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
4. Download the JSON credentials file
5. Configure gmailr in your R session:
```r
library(gmailr)
gm_auth_configure(path = "path/to/your/credentials.json")
gm_auth(email = TRUE, cache = ".secret")
```

### Option 3: HeelMail Setup (Required for HeelMail Department Emails)
For sending emails to departments via UNC HeelMail, you'll need:

1. **UNC Credentials**: Your ONYEN username and password
2. **Firefox Browser**: Must be installed on your system
3. **MFA Access**: Ability to receive MFA codes via text
