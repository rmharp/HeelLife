Description: A toolset to programmatically access and scrape contact information 
    for student organizations from the UNC Chapel Hill 'Heel Life' website. 
    It handles the login process, navigates the organization list, and extracts 
    details such as organization name, member names, positions, and emails. 
    This package requires user credentials for the UNC 'Heel Life' portal and 
    an interactive session to handle multi-factor authentication.
